# Variables

## What is a Variable?

- A varibale is a "container" that can store data
  - Example:
    - Users Name
    - Users Age
    - Data
- There are different rules for variables in Python:
  - Variables must begin with a letter or underscore
  - The rest of the variable may consist of anything - Variables are case-sensitive

## Code Order

- Code in ran from top to bottom

- As shown, when we redeclared our variable, and re-printed, the value was changed. But if we were to print the variable after the first assignment, it will print the first one.

- If you were to put a print statement at the top with the variable paramater passed in, then you will recieve an error
